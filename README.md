# TollBalance

## Description

The TollBalance platform is designed to provide comprehensive solutions for managing debts and analyzing traffic and debt related data. The software will serve as a tool for companies to track and settle its debts, track amounts owed, and gain insights into traffic patterns, tolls usage, and revenue distribution by various charts and plots that will be offered. It will also provide historical data and analytics for better financial decision-making. The system will be accessible only to authorized company employees.

## Contributors

- **Antigoni Karanika**: Took charge of developing the API for the website and its corresponding documentation.

- **Giannis Dimoulas**: Focused on all aspects related to the database, primarily handling the queries required for the API endpoints.

- **Iliana Maggiori**: Handled the development of the frontend for the software, delivering a dynamic and user-friendly interface.

- **Manolis Pantelakis**: Organized and oversaw the project. He was responsible for developing the Functional API endpoints and the CLI, as well as handling both functional API and CLI testing. Additionally, he contributed to the documentation for the Functional API.

The development of the UML diagrams and the SRS document was a collaborative effort.

## Features

- **Frontend**: Built with React, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Express.js, handling all API requests and server-side logic.
- **Database**: MySQL is used for managing and storing application data.
- **CLI Tool**: A JavaScript-based CLI tool to interact with the application programmatically.
- **Testing**: Includes functional testing for CLI functionality and Postman API testing to ensure reliable backend endpoints.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (for API testing)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ntua/softeng24-08.git
cd softeng24-08
```

### 2. Set up the Backend

#### 1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd back-end
npm install
```

#### 2. Set up MySQL database:

- Locate `DDL.sql` and `DML.sql` files in back-end/database directory.
- Run the `DDL` script to create the necessary tables by sourcing the SQL script:

```bash
mysql -u your-username -p your-password
source path/to/DDL.sql;
```

- After running the DDL script, run the `DML` script to populate the database with initial data:

```bash
source path/to/DML.sql;
```

### 3. Set up the Frontend

#### Install dependencies:

```bash
cd front-end/react-app
npm install
```

### 4. Set up the CLI Client

```bash
cd cli-client
npm install
```

### 5. Set Up Environment Variables

#### 1. Create the `.env` File in the Backend Directory

In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file.

#### 2. Configure the `.env` File with the Following Variables

You need to configure the `.env` file with the necessary environment variables for your database, JWT authentication, and SSL setup:

```text
DB_HOST: The host of your MySQL database
DB_USER: The username for your database
DB_PASSWORD: The password for your database
DB_NAME: The name of the database to use
JWT_SECRET: A secret key for JWT authentication
SSL_KEY: The path to the SSL private key
SSL_CERT: The path to the SSL certificate
```

The contents of the .env file should look like the following example:

```text
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=toll_balance

# JWT Secret for Authentication
JWT_SECRET=

# SSL Configuration
SSL_KEY=ssl/server.key
SSL_CERT=ssl/server.cert
```

#### 3. Replace Placeholders with the Appropriate Values

- Replace `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` with your MySQL database connection details.
- The paths for SSL_KEY and SSL_CERT should be exactly as shown above: ssl/server.key for the SSL private key and ssl/server.cert for the SSL certificate.

### 6. Set up SSL encryption

To enable SSL encryption for secure connections, you'll need to generate self-signed certificates (if you don't already have them) and place them in the `ssl/` folder inside the `backend` directory.

1. **Create the `ssl/` folder inside the `backend` directory**:

```bash
mkdir back-end/ssl
```

2. **Generate Self-Signed Certificates (if you donâ€™t have them already):**

```bash
cd back-end/ssl
openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert
```

This command will create the following files in the backend/ssl folder:

- `server.key`: The private key
- `server.cert`: The self-signed certificate

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server

Once the backend is set up, you can start the server. Make sure you're in the `back-end` directory, then run the following command:

```bash
node app.js
```

This will start the backend server on https://localhost:9115. If you have configured the .env file correctly, the server should run without any issues.

### 2. Start the Frontend Application

Once the frontend is set up, you can start the React application. Navigate to the front-end/react-app directory and run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the frontend application on https://localhost:3000.

### 3. Run the CLI Tool

After setting up the CLI client, you can use the command-line tool to interact with the backend programmatically. To run the CLI tool, navigate to the cli-client directory and use the following command:

```bash
chmod +x index.js
npm link
```

To view all the available options for the CLI tool, run the following command:

```bash
se2408 -h
```

This will display a list of all available commands and options for interacting with the backend.
